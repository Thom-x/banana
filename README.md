## CI
Jenkins 2 runs the build.pipeline script after each commit (delayed to 5 minutes) : if the build is successfull, the artifact is deployed to FTP (credentials needed) 

## Trouble shooting
If the file QStory.java seems missing, you should configure your IDE to include target/generated-sources to the list of source directories
